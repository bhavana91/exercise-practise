[200~JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
this makes the java script as unique.
Full integration with HTML/CSS.
Simple things are done simply.
Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.
let – is a modern variable declaration.
var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
data types:
1.Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
We can get it as a result of division by zero:
2.NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance.
3. if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result.
4.BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer literal:
strings:
In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
Double quotes: "Hello".
Single quotes: 'Hello'.
Backticks: `Hello`.
boolean::
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

The “null” value:
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:
JavaScript that type of null is an object.

The typeof operator
The typeof  operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to  process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick  check.
It supports two forms of syntax:
As an operator: typeof x.
As a function: typeof(x).
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.
number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean for true/false.
null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object for more complex data structures.
symbol for unique identifiers.
The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.
Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
TYPE CONVERSIONS:
Numeric conversion rules:
Value
Becomes…
undefined
NaN
null
0
true and false
1 and 0
string
Whitespaces from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is 0. Otherwise, the number is “read” from the string. An error gives NaN.

String Conversion – Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with String(value). The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.
Numeric Conversion – Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with Number(value).
undefined is Nan as a number, not 0.
"0" and space-only strings like " " are true as a Boolean.
An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.
An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:


Bitwise operators
Bit wise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.
These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.
The list of operators:
AND ( & )
OR ( | )
XOR ( ^ )
NOT ( ~ )
LEFT SHIFT ( << )
RIGHT SHIFT ( >> )
ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( >>> )

alert,prompt,confirm messages:
alert :shows a message.
alert syntax  - > alert(message);
prompt: shows a message asking the user to input text. It returns the text or, if Cancel button or Esc is clicked, null.
prompt syntax - > result = prompt(title, [default]);
where title which will show to the user.
where default is defined as 
An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.
confirm:shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK” or “Cancel”. It returns true for OK and false for Cancel/Esc.
confirm syntax - > result=confirm(question).
logical operators: they are three types of logical operators they are 
or ,and, not
or:
if both the conditions are false then only the condition or operator WILL BE false.
and:
if both the values are true  then only it will go for true otherwise it will go for false.
not:
if the value is true it will return as  false and if the value as false the it will return as  true.
loops: for running the condition for multiple times based on the condition 
while , do while ,  for
while - >The condition is checked before each iteration.. first it will check the condition then it ill go for execution
while(condition){
//code to be executed.
}
do while -  >The condition is checked after each iteration.. after execution it will check the condition.
do{
//code to be executed
}
while(condition)
for - >
for (begin; condition; step) {
//code to be executed
}
break - >we can also use break stmt to stop the execution of loop at particular condition.
continue - >we can use continue statement it will skip the condition where we have written the continue statement .it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).


functions - >
 Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.
function name(parameters) {
  ...body...
}
function declaration and function expression:
Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow.
// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Function Expression: a function, created inside an  expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is  created at the right side of the “assignment expression” =:
// Function Expression
let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

Arrow functions:
syntax:
let func = (arg1, arg2, ...argN) => expression
Objects:
They store properties (key-value pairs), where:
Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
Values can be of any type.

1.objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.
2.An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
 note::
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true  // multiword property name must be quoted
};
 to access any property we will go for . notation.
To delete a property: delete obj.prop.
To check if a property with the given key exists: "key" in obj.
To iterate over an object: for (let key in obj) loop.
The “for…in” loop
To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: for..in. This is a completely different thing from the for(;;) construct that we studied before.
The syntax:
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
 ex:
 let user={
name:sai,
age:30
};
for( let key in user){
alert(key);
 alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
}

we can use object assign instead of cloning
Also we can use the method Object.assign or _.cloneDeep(obj).for that.
The syntax is:
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
 to check weather the object is empty or not is isEmpty(obj).
this - >
To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.

date and time:
An integer number representing the number of milliseconds that has passed since the beginning of 1970 is called a timestamp.
It’s a lightweight numeric representation of a date. We can always create a date from a timestamp using new Date(timestamp) and convert the existing Date object to a timestamp using the date.getTime() method (see below).

There are methods to access the year, month and so on from the Date object:
getFullYear()
Get the year (4 digits)
getMonth()
Get the month, from 0 to 11.
getDate()
Get the day of month, from 1 to 31, the name of the method does look a little bit strange.
getHours(), getMinutes(), getSeconds(), getMilliseconds()
Get the corresponding time components.


classes:

The instanceof operator allows to check whether an object belongs to a certain class. It also takes inheritance into account.
stntax:

ARRAYS:

 indexof(value):
finds the position of element if found it will give position otherwise it will give -1 if not found.
includes(value):
if the value present in the array it will give the true value otherwise gives false value if not found
lastindexof(value,starts from index(right to left)):
arr.slice:
The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object.
The slice() method selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at, but does not include, the given end argument.
Note: The original array will not be changed.
let arr=[1,2,3,6,7,4,5];
console.log(arr.slice(1,4));op//2,3,6
arr.splice(position to be inserted,start from index,value to be inserted):
this will form an diff array by copying all the data from the array on which we are doing splice function and gives the new array as output.
let arr=[1,2,4,5];
console.log(arr.splice(2,0,3));op//1,2,3,4,5.
arr.map(item=>item.functoin need to perform like.length or *2):
it will give the result like which function we have performed over the array.
let arr=["hi","hlo"];
console.log(arr.map(a=>a.length));
arr.find():
The find() method returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.

const arr=[1,2,3,4];
arr.find(index=index>1);
condole.log(arr);o/p///2,3,4
foreach():
it will return the each and evry element in th e arrayby using the loop format.
const arr=['a','b',
arr.filter():
var newArray = arr.filter(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])
it will gives the output based on the condition on which the user has mentioned. will check hole array.
arr.some(item=>item(condition)):
1.The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
2.means we need to pass a condition that should stratify at-least one element in the array if satisfied then return true otherwise false.
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// checks whether an element is even
const even = (element) => element % 2 === 0;
console.log(array.some(even));//op is true.
arr.every(item=>item(condition)):
1.The every() method tests whether all the elements in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
2.means we need to pass a condition that should stratify all elements in the array if satisfied then return true otherwise false.
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// checks whether an element is even
const even = (element) => element % 2 === 0;
console.log(array.every(even));//op is true.
join():
The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.
const elements = ['Fire', 'Air', 'Water'];
console.log(elements.join());
// expected output: "Fire,Air,Water"
console.log(elements.join(''));
// expected output: "FireAirWater"
console.log(elements.join('-'));
// expected output: "Fire-Air-Water"
reduce():
The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
const arr=[1,3,4,5,7];
const result = arr.reduce((word,item) => word+item);
console.log(result);
strings:
str.indexof(indexposition):
gives the position of index of starting index string.
str.search(string):
it will check weather the given string is present 
str.charat(position):
it will give u the element which is present in the given position.
str.replace(nameof the string that need to be replace ,string that need to be replace);
IT IS going to replace first occurence of that string with the string to be replaced. 
str.match(values):
it will give the all the matched possibilites as a output.
var paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It barked.';
var regex = /[a-z]/g;
var found = paragraph.match(regex);

console.log(found);
// expected output:> Array ["h", "e", "q", "u", "i", "c", "k", "b", "r", "o", "w", "n", "f", "o", "x", "j", "u", "m", "p", "s", "o", "v", "e", "r", "t", "h", "e", "l", "a", "z", "y", "d", "o", "g", "t", "b", "a", "r", "k", "e", "d"]
